Tom and Lily were playing with their toys in the living room. They liked to build towers and bridges with their blocks and cars. Tom was very proud of his tall tower. He wanted to make it even taller, so he reached for more blocks.
"Tom, can I have some blocks too?" Lily asked. She wanted to make a bridge for her cars.
"No, these are mine. Go find your own," Tom said. He did not want to share with his sister. He pulled the blocks closer to him.
Lily felt sad and angry. She did not think Tom was being nice. She looked at his tower and had an idea. She decided to pull one of the blocks at the bottom of the tower.
Suddenly, the tower fell down with a loud crash. All the blocks and cars scattered on the floor. Tom and Lily were shocked. They felt the floor shake and heard a rumble. It was an earthquake!
"Mommy! Daddy!" they cried. They were scared and ran to their parents, who were in the kitchen.
"Are you okay, kids?" Mommy asked. She hugged them and checked if they were hurt.
"We're okay, Mommy. But our toys are broken," Lily said.
"I'm sorry, Lily. But toys are not important. You are important. We are safe and together. That's what matters," Mommy said.
Tom felt sorry for what he did. He realized he was selfish and mean to his sister. He saw how scared she was during the earthquake. He wanted to make her happy.
"Lily, I'm sorry I did not share with you. You can have all the blocks you want. I love you, sister," Tom said.
Lily smiled and hugged him. She forgave him and thanked him. She loved him too.
They went back to the living room and cleaned up their toys. They decided to build something together. They made a big house with a garden and a fence. They put their cars and dolls inside. They were happy and proud of their work.
Mommy and Daddy came to see their house. They praised them and gave them a treat. It was a lemon cake. It was sour, but they liked it. They learned that sharing is caring, and that family is sweet.

They took the pot to their room and put it on the floor. They opened their box of crayons, stickers, and glitter. They started to draw and stick and sprinkle on the pot. They made colorful shapes and patterns. They thought the pot looked very nice.
But they were clumsy. They did not see that they also made a big mess. They spilled glitter on the floor and the bed. They stuck stickers on the wall and the door. They drew crayons on the window and the dresser. They did not hear Mom come home.
Mom saw the mess in the kitchen. She saw the glitter, the stickers, and the crayons. She was angry. She followed the trail to their room. She saw the pot. She saw the floor, the bed, the wall, the door, the window, and the dresser. She was very angry.
She said, "Lily and Tom, what did you do? You ruined my pot and my room. You are very naughty. You have to clean up everything. And you have to say sorry."
Lily and Tom were scared. They did not mean to make Mom angry. They only wanted to decorate the pot. They said, "Sorry, Mom. We love you. We will clean up. Please don't be mad."
Mom sighed. She was still angry, but she also loved them. She said, "I love you too, but you have to be careful. You can't touch my things without asking. And you can't make a mess like this. You have to learn to be more tidy and respectful."
Lily and Tom nodded. They hugged Mom and said, "We will, Mom. We will." They took a broom, a dustpan, and a cloth. They started to clean up their mess. They hoped Mom would forgive them. They learned their lesson. They would not decorate Mom's pot again.

Lily and Max were playing in the park with their mom. They liked to slide, swing, and run on the grass. They also liked to listen to the birds that made whistles in the trees.
"Look, mom, a red bird!" Lily said, pointing to a cardinal.
"That's a pretty bird, Lily. Do you know what it is called?" mom asked.
"A cardinal, mom. I learned it in school," Lily said proudly.
"Very good, Lily. And do you know what that yellow bird is, Max?" mom asked, pointing to a canary.
"A canary, mom. I learned it in school, too," Max said.
"Wow, you are both very smart. Do you want to learn another bird name?" mom asked.
"Yes, mom, yes!" Lily and Max said.
"OK, see that blue bird over there? That's a blue jay. It has a very loud whistle. Can you try to whistle like it?" mom asked.
Lily and Max tried to whistle, but they only made funny noises. They laughed and mom laughed, too.
"Whistling is hard, mom. How do you do it?" Lily asked.
"It takes practice, Lily. Maybe when you are older, you can whistle better. But you know what? You don't need to whistle to have fun. You can sing, or clap, or dance, or make any sound you like," mom said.
"I like to sing, mom. Can we sing a song?" Max asked.
"Sure, Max. What song do you want to sing?" mom asked.
"How about 'Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star'?" Max suggested.
"OK, let's sing it together," mom said.
They sang the song and looked at the sky. The sun was shining and the clouds were light and fluffy.
"That was a nice song, mom. But I'm feeling sleepy now. Can we nap?" Lily asked.
"Me too, mom. Can we nap?" Max asked.
"Of course, my sweeties. Let's go to the car and nap. You had a busy day," mom said.
They walked to the car and mom buckled them in their seats. She gave them each a kiss and a hug.
"Sleep well, my loves. I'll wake you up when we get home," mom said.
Lily and Max closed their eyes and fell asleep. They dreamed of birds and stars and whistles. They were happy.
